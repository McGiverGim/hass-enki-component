## Live API test

This repository includes a standalone live diagnostics script that can authenticate against Enki
and print available devices/actions from your account. This can help to develop and debug the
component against the real API.

Before running it locally, install runtime dependencies:

```bash
python -m pip install aiohttp
```

Run the script with credentials as parameters:

```bash
python tools/enki_api_live.py --user "your-email@example.com" --password "your-password"
```

You can also use environment variables:

```bash
export ENKI_USER="your-email@example.com"
export ENKI_PASSWORD="your-password"
python tools/enki_api_live.py
```
